My name is Theo. I am currently a computer science and mathematics student at Harvey Mudd College. Feel free to look around at my projects and reach out if you have any questions/have something fun to talk about! 

Check out my website for a more detailed description of my projects: [theorode.com](https://www.theorode.com) (hopefully I can keep this relatively updated).
