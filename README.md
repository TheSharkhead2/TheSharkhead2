# Hello! 

My name is Theo and I am currently a college student. I love building simulations to explore the world and making small programs to entertain myself or make something slightly easier. Feel free to explore my GitHub and find some of the projects I have been entertaining myself with! 

## Current Projects

I have a bit of a bad habbit of starting a bunch of projects and never finishing them. But these are the main projects I am working on right now. I am not listing the smaller-scale projects I am doing for class or complete before I have a chance to update this. 

- [Julia_Spotify](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/Julia_Spotify) 
   * I wanted to work on a project to both further my understanding/familiarity with Julia, while also being something that I could use for something interesting. As you can see in the [future projects](#future-projects) section, I really want to do some kind of summary application for my Spotify data. I figured, why not create an endpoint for the API that I could use later in that project (if I ever get around to it). I haven't worked on it properly in a while, but I have so far managed almost all of the necessary functionality you would expect. Following what I currently have, I plan to add a "formatting" layer of sorts which will return all the various artists, ablums, songs, etc, as custom objects within Julia to hopefully reduce clutter.  

- [MathV2](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/MathV2)
   * In the last few years, I have found myself truly in love with math. But much of this is because I actually learned math for the first time. I learned about the creativity, exploration, and discovery that truly describes math, rather than the sheer computation and memorization of math up until college level. It was so much fun to actually explore problems, discover solutions, and problem solve! But it is truly sad that so many people will never get to find that joy that I have found. So many people give up on math before they ever learn it because they don't enjoy complicated computation and memorization. I have news for you, most people don't like these things. I want to work on a new way of teaching math where this doesn't happen. Where students become truly excited to learn about math and are immersed in real math from the beginning. This is a long term project where I am writing class notes for a new math cirriculum from 6th to 12th grade covering most of what is normally taught in that time, just in a better way (hopefully... At the end of the day I am probably completely clueless and this is just a bit of fun/inspiration for someone else). 

- Discord Bot
   * From the start of the pandemic I've been maintaining/updating a multipurpose Discord bot for a small server with my friends. It simply started out as a quick laugh, storing many of the questionable quotes from people, but has quickly turned into a minigame of sorts. I've implemented trivial "easter eggs" resulting in little quips from the bot, but I have also created an expansive text-based escape room or a pseudo trivia game show. Really this is just a bit of fun with friends, but I have learned a fair amount about maintaining a project as I have forced myself to go through the process of writing patch notes, creating a reasonable git commit messages, and organizing versions into various branches. 

## Future Projects 

There are quite a few projects I would be interested in pursuing next, however here are a few of them: 

- Implementing a neural network from scratch 
   * I have worked with straight neural networks before as well as CNNs and LSTM networks, however I have found that building my own implementations of things can really improve my understanding of them and I still feel that I don't entirely grasp neural networks to the extent that I could. 

- Spotify summary data
   * I worked on both an interface for Spotipy (Spotify API) as well as a machine learning program that tried to predict how much I would like a certain song (which unsurprisingly didn't work well), but I think another project that would be incredibly interesting would be a graphical/numerial summary of music taste. Spotify gives a lot of data on all songs and I think I could find some cool comparisons between me and my friends.
