My name is Theo and I am currently a high school (almost college) student. I love building simulations to explore the world and making small programs to entertain myself or make something slightly easier. Feel free to explore my GitHub and find some of the projects I have been entertaining myself with! 

## Current Projects

A lot of the projects on my github are actually in progress (or stunted because of time constraints). Here is a more explicit list of everything I am working on currently: 

- [RPGGAME2](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/rpggame2)
   * Yeah so it doesn't have a name. But the first version of this game I uploaded to github because it is probably my favorite coding project to date. The idea with the second version is to make it a bit more graphically interesting (the first game didn't have graphics), but also clean up the code substantially as the main reason I didn't get to everything I had planned for the first game was the code became unmanagable. While yes I am building this in python, when I started this project it was my favorite language so I wanted to stick with what I was used to. One of the big things I have had to learn for this project is the pygame library, which wasn't too dificult considering my experience with similar environments (React Native), but was new to me (and I couldn't find amazing tutorials). This has been a project I haven't worked on in a while, however it is something which I truly wish to finish as I have always loved game development. 

- [Spotipy function set](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/SpotipyFunction_Set)
   * This is a project a friend and I have been working on so that we can make our work with the Spotify API easier. We were both really struggling with using the API, and both working on projects involving it, so this is essentially a combination of simplification of content (sometimes it wasn't the nicest) and some useful additional functions for certain features we were commonly using. This project contains most of the really useful stuff we wanted to add, however there is still some to add which we might get to at some point. 

- Discord Bot
   * No fancy name for this one (and also no link to a project, can't really put it online). Basically, I am building a Discord bot for my friends and me that can do a variety of fun little things to make our Discord server more entertaining. I have been maintaining this on and off over the last year and a half and have been enjoying it. It is fairly easy programming that allows me to learn to use the Discord API while also giving my friends a good time. So it is all around a fun project.

## Future Projects 

There are quite a few projects I would be interested in pursuing next, however here are a few of them: 

- Implementing a neural network from scratch 
   * I have worked with straight neural networks before as well as CNNs and LSTM networks, however I have found that building my own implementations of things can really improve my understanding of them and I still feel that I don't entirely grasp neural networks to the extent that I could. 

- Spotify summary data
   * I worked on both an interface for Spotipy (Spotify API) as well as a machine learning program that tried to predict how much I would like a certain song (which unsurprisingly didn't work well), but I think another project that would be incredibly interesting would be a graphical/numerial summary of music taste. Spotify gives a lot of data on all songs and I think I could find some cool comparisons between me and my friends. 

- Some kind of evolution/natural selection simulation 
   * I love to watch videos on these types of simulations and I am always interested in building my own model of this to mess with different genes and see what comes out.
