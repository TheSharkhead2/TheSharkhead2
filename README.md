# Hello! 

My name is Theo and I am currently a high school (almost college) student. I love building simulations to explore the world and making small programs to entertain myself or make something slightly easier. Feel free to explore my GitHub and find some of the projects I have been entertaining myself with! 

## Current Projects

I have a bit of a bad habbit of starting a bunch of projects and never finishing them. But these are the main projects I am working on right now. I am not listing the smaller-scale projects I am doing for class or complete before I have a chance to update this. 

- [Julia_Spotify](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/Julia_Spotify) 
   * I have done a fair amount of work with the Spotify API for various projects, but it was always through the [Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) Python endpoint. To make my job a bit easier, I worked a fair amount on a project to clean up the API overall, [SpotipyFunction_Set](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/SpotipyFunction_Set), but this was still using Spotipy as a base. Ever since I have moved to Julia as a primary language, I haven't had a Spotipy. So, both to get a library to use for Spotify projects in the future and to get experience with APIs, I wanted to make my own Spotify API endpoint in Julia (this does technically [exist in Julia](https://github.com/kwehmeyer/Spotify.jl), but this is still a good excuse for a project). 

- Discord Bot
   * For various reasons I can't post this publically, but for the past year and a half I have been maintaining a small Discord bot for a server with some friends. It is essentially a collection of small games/fun functions for my friends to play around with. Recently, I created a large, digital escape room with custom puzzles for this project. 

## Future Projects 

There are quite a few projects I would be interested in pursuing next, however here are a few of them: 

- Implementing a neural network from scratch 
   * I have worked with straight neural networks before as well as CNNs and LSTM networks, however I have found that building my own implementations of things can really improve my understanding of them and I still feel that I don't entirely grasp neural networks to the extent that I could. 

- Spotify summary data
   * I worked on both an interface for Spotipy (Spotify API) as well as a machine learning program that tried to predict how much I would like a certain song (which unsurprisingly didn't work well), but I think another project that would be incredibly interesting would be a graphical/numerial summary of music taste. Spotify gives a lot of data on all songs and I think I could find some cool comparisons between me and my friends. 

- Some kind of evolution/natural selection simulation 
   * I love to watch videos on these types of simulations and I am always interested in building my own model of this to mess with different genes and see what comes out.
