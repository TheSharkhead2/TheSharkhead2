# Hello! 

My name is Theo. I have a variety of interests, most notably computer vision and general AI/ML, but additionally in remote sensing, opinion dynamics, and applied mathematics. Feel free to reach out with cool ideas/just to say hi! 

My GitHub has been highly skewed by many private repositories -- sorry about that ðŸ« .
