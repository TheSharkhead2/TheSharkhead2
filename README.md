# Hello! 

My name is Theo and I am currently a high school (almost college) student. I love coding and math.

Coding is really amazing to me because it allows me to create solutions to many problems that few other tools allow. I can model situations I find confusing to figure out patterns or build a program that just makes a task easier. I have recently been enjoying using the Julia language, but previously primarily used Python. In addition, I also have experience with JavaScript as well as, while not languages, React Native and Unreal Engine 4. One of the topics I find most interesting in the field of computer science is artificial intelligence. In the last year or two, I have experimented with neural networks, decision trees, clustering, etc. Computer vision has also become quite interesting to me as I have been taking a class in it this year. The project [imageProcessing](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/imageProcessing) has been my work for specifically computer vision where I have been attempting to implement the algorithms I am finding interesting. 

In math, I truly fell in love when I learned calculus for the first time, so that is probably still my favorite topic in math. I am currently diving into the world of differential equations and linear algebra and enjoyed multivariable calculus as well as graph theory last year (There are some projects here which relate to these classes. Either computational exercises or the like). I have absolutely loved diving into these classes and hope to take even more math into the future. Unrelated to programming, but I have recently also become interested in the pedagogy of math and how we teach it. This has led me to create lessons of my own (for calculus in particular), which has been a project I have quite enjoyed. I would love to talk to you about this if you are also interested in it! 

Overall, my github is mostly full of passion projects. There is a game or two I worked on, but also interfaces for the Spotify API and some COVID-19 modeling (though this particular project is not done at all. I had worked on this previously and got interesting results and wanted to work on a more ambitious project, but couldn't find the time). Feel free to explore and talk to me about what you see :). 

## Current Projects

A lot of the projects on my github are actually in progress (or stunted because of time constraints). Here is a more explicit list of everything I am working on currently: 

- [SHA256 implementation](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/sha256) 
   * This isn't a massive project, however for the last three years I have been interested in how this particular hash algorithm works and I now have a reason to build an implementation of it (as an open-ended project for my computer security class). I am following a tutorial, however as it is written in python, I am trying my best to fix the somewhat not-amazing code which the tutorial uses as I am translating it to Julia. 

- [RPGGAME2](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/rpggame2)
   * Yeah so it doesn't have a name. But the first version of this game I uploaded to github because it is probably my favorite coding project to date. The idea with the second version is to make it a bit more graphically interesting (the first game didn't have graphics), but also clean up the code substantially as the main reason I didn't get to everything I had planned for the first game was the code became unmanagable. While yes I am building this in python, when I started this project it was my favorite language so I wanted to stick with what I was used to. One of the big things I have had to learn for this project is the pygame library, which wasn't too dificult considering my experience with similar environments (React Native), but was new to me (and I couldn't find amazing tutorials). This has been a project I haven't worked on in a while, however it is something which I truly wish to finish as I have always loved game development. 

- [Spotipy function set](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/SpotipyFunction_Set)
   * This is a project a friend and I have been working on so that we can make our work with the Spotify API easier. We were both really struggling with using the API, and both working on projects involving it, so this is essentially a combination of simplification of content (sometimes it wasn't the nicest) and some useful additional functions for certain features we were commonly using. This project contains most of the really useful stuff we wanted to add, however there is still some to add which we might get to at some point. 

- [Image processing algorithms](https://github.com/TheSharkhead2/imageProcessing)
   * As I mentioned above, this is a project which is me putting together a bunch of my own implementations created for a class I am currently taking. I am almost entirely creating these implementations as an extention of the class as I truly find it fun and productive for me to learn about the algorithms. The general goal of the project is to construct as much as I can from scratch so that I get as good of an understanding as possible. As I have found this topic incredibly interesting, and there are many, many more topics to cover, I will most likely continue this project past the class adding my own implementations of algorithms or functions I find interesting. 

## Future Projects 

There are quite a few projects I would be interested in pursuing next, however here are a few of them: 

- Implementing a neural network from scratch 
   * I have worked with straight neural networks before as well as CNNs and LSTM networks, however I have found that building my own implementations of things can really improve my understanding of them and I still feel that I don't entirely grasp neural networks to the extent that I could. 

- Spotify summary data
   * I worked on both an interface for Spotipy (Spotify API) as well as a machine learning program that tried to predict how much I would like a certain song (which unsurprisingly didn't work well), but I think another project that would be incredibly interesting would be a graphical/numerial summary of music taste. Spotify gives a lot of data on all songs and I think I could find some cool comparisons between me and my friends. 

- Some kind of evolution/natural selection simulation 
   * I love to watch videos on these types of simulations and I am always interested in building my own model of this to mess with different genes and see what comes out.
